## BUDGETS
Each Building PTO and PTO Council shall be responsible for maintaining a budget, against which regular expenditures are levied.

Prior to the start of the school year, the draft should be discussed, amended and approved at a regular meeting by the corresponding Board per the voting requirements in these by-laws.   Each line item should be reviewed.   Historical data is helpful but should not preclude thoughtful discussion of each program.

Although the individual components of that line do not need to be recorded or approved, the Board should have a general understanding of what types of expenses will be covered by each budget line.   Line items without defined purpose or funding direction are not permitted.   
3.	Once approved, budget allocations may be drawn upon freely by the corresponding committee without line item approval.   If however, it is discovered that expenditures must exceed budgeted amounts, additional funds may be requested and approved by vote.   Commitments or purchases cannot be made until a vote has taken place.   Each Committee Chair is to review the balance of their budget allocation at each meeting and, if necessary, request additional funds at that time to avoid last minute and/or electronic votes. 
4.	The current board should leave a cash operating fund on hand for the following year, equal to the amount needed to fund events and programs that occur prior to collection of the major fundraiser.

## EXPENDITURES
Cash outlays will be made by the treasurer when accompanied by proper forms (see Appendix) and supporting documentation.   Supporting documentation may include original receipts, signed contracts or funding requests.   When these documents are not available, an expenditure may be made at the treasurer’s discretion, subject to approval by the PTO Council Treasurer.    An expenditure will be granted under any of the following conditions:
1.	An expense is allocated against a budgeted line, and is less than the remaining budget balance for that line.   The corresponding committee chairperson should submit this expense.
2.	An expense falls under a budgeted line, there is not enough budget balance remaining for the expense, but a vote by the Board has occurred approving additional funds.   A corresponding committee chairperson should submit this expense.
3.	A funding request has been submitted and approved.    A funding request form (see Appendix) should be completed by Building or District staff to request financial support for items/programs or services that are not addressed in the PTO Budget.   The funding request should be presented by the requestor and/or the Building President and discussed at a PTO meeting and subjected to vote.   When motioning a vote for a funding request, the Treasurer should be prepared to report on the projected cash surplus or deficit for the year to determine the feasibility of the request.   
4.	In situations where a fundraiser has netted surplus funds, or the funding direction of a revenue-generating program has not been specifically identified or quantified in the budget approval process, the President may motion for a vote to allocate those funds.    This allocation should be discussed with the Building Staff in advance.  
5.	If “petty cash” is required to make change at a revenue-generating event, the Treasurer is authorized to provide up to $200 without supporting documentation to the Committee Chair.   The $200 must be returned to the Treasurer within the receipts of the event.
6.	In an emergency situation, a President may approve an unbudgeted expenditure of up to $100 without a vote of the Board, not to exceed three separate emergencies within a PTO fiscal year.
7.	Regardless of the above conditions, all expenditures must support the mission of the PTO and be in accordance with these by-laws.

3.	On a monthly basis, each Treasurer should prepare financial documents for their accounts as prescribed by PTO Council (see Appendix).   These reports must disclose receipts and disbursements made, current status of budget, restricted/reserved funds and cash balance available as verified by a bank statement.    The Building or Council President must validate the bank balance to these financial reports and document validation with a signature.
4.	Each Treasurer is responsible for maintaining an accurate check signing register with the bank, not to exceed current Treasurer, current President and Treasurer of PTO Council.    
5.	The Treasurer of PTO Council shall have access to all PTO bank accounts for the purposes of investigating concerns and verifying reporting on an ongoing basis.    PTO Council Executive Committee may commission a special audit of the financial records of any Building PTO if deemed necessary.
6.	When collecting receipts for any event, a representative of the corresponding committee shall prepare proper documentation for the receipts (see appendix), shall count and double count the receipts, sign off and present the deposit to the Treasurer or secure the deposit in the safe within 48 hours of the event, notifying the Treasurer.   In the event that the receipts exceed $500, the receipts must be double counted by another committee representative.   The Treasurer shall complete a third count of receipts, and may not perform the first or second counts.
